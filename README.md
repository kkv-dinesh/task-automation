# Task Automation in Python

This repository contains Python scripts for automating various tasks. Each task focuses on a specific automation aspect, including email automation, PDF text extraction, PDF merging, and image processing.

## Tasks Included

### 1. Email Automation

The script `email_automation.py` demonstrates how to automate sending emails using the `smtplib` module in Python. It provides an example of how to send emails with attachments and customize the email content.

### 2. PDF Text Extraction

The script `pdf_text_extraction.py` demonstrates how to extract text from PDF files using the `PyPDF2` library. It shows how to open a PDF file, extract text from each page, and save the extracted text to a text file.

### 3. PDF Merging

The script `pdf_merging.py` demonstrates how to merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF file using the `PyPDF2` library. It shows how to specify the order of the input PDF files and save the merged PDF file.

### 4. Image Processing

The script `image_processing.py` demonstrates various image processing operations using the `Pillow` library. It provides examples of resizing images, applying filters, and saving the processed images.

## Requirements

To run these scripts, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- `smtplib` for email automation
- `PyPDF2` for PDF text extraction and merging
- `Pillow` for image processing

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install smtplib PyPDF2 Pillow
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
